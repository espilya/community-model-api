# SPICE Community Model

The Community Model supports the social cohesion across groups, by the understanding of their differences and recognizing what they have in common. The community model is responsible for storing information about explicit communities that users belong to. Additionally, it creates the implicit communities inferred from user interactions and it computes the metrics needed to define the similarity (and dissimilarity) among group of users. The Community Model will support the recommender system in the variety and serendipity to the recommendation results, that will not be oriented to the typically popular contents or based on providing similar contents to the users (the so called, filter bubble) but to the inter-group similarities and the intra-group differences. 

## Quick start

1. Install Docker Desktop following the instructions on the official [Docker web page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Launch Docker Desktop App
3. Create a `.env` file in the `deploy` folder using the `env.template` file and following the instructions in it
4. Deploy the Community Model using docker and command line:
	- Windows:
	  - Execute using command line `docker-compose --env-file .env build && docker-compose up`  from `deploy` folder.
	- Linux:
	  - Replace **`;`** with **`:`** in the last lines of the `/deploy/.env` file
	  - Execute using command line `docker-compose --env-file .env build && docker-compose up`  from `deploy` folder.


## Developing

Follow the instructions in the `deploy/env.template` file to configure a development environment.
